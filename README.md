# Vegan App
In this web app the user can add one or more ingredients, and the app will tell whether the list of these ingredients is totally vegan or not. If it isn't, it would show which exactly ingredients are non-vegan. <br />
For creating this app I used HTML, CSS, React and an NPM package [is-vegan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-vegan).
